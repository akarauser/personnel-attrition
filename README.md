Personnel Attrition Prediction

This script performs data analysis and predictive modeling on an employee dataset. It uses techniques such as data exploration, preprocessing, feature selection (via feature importance), and model building with a Random Forest Classifier. Key practices include handling missing data with mean imputation, scaling numerical features, one-hot encoding categorical features, and cross-validation for robust model evaluation. The code also logs the entire process for debugging and reproducibility.
